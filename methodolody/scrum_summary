Scrum is an agil, incremental and iterative methodology, for me, the most interesting part of this topic
was the principles that handle, the first one is individuals and interactions over processes, this is 
more about how a process is being done, if you realize that something is being done in a wrong way, or
if you think that something can improve, you can say it. The second one is working software over documentation, 
which refers to get things done over having a pretty well structured documentation, this doesn't mean that you 
don't have to do documentation, it's fine, just that it's more important finish the project activities. 
The third one is customer collaboration, over contract negotiation this means that since the begining, you 
have to talk with the client about what's gonna be done with the project for example, requirements, deadline, and 
budget, one of the main advices was that you can't ever have these three together, if you've a time stablish 
and a budget, requirements have to be negotiated, if you have budget and requirements, you have to estimate the 
time, you will never have all of this items.This is another line out of the context of the summary, just for change the repo. And the
last one is responding to change over follow a plan, as i understood, this is more about the way in which you take feedback, when you
're working in a project you have to be sure that what you're doing will succeed, that why you first should make tests or ask about 
hether what'you're doing is good for 
the market, because if you follow a plan and at the end it results that all was a waste of time, it's just bad for all.
This has nothing to do with the former lines.
Omaury told me to do this , but he hasn't got his poncho. The poncho is the source of his power.
